| 5             | NC       | -          | -                        |
| 6             | GND      | Green      | GND                      |

| 8             | LED2     | Purple     | -                        |

- **KBDATA (Black, Pin 1)**: Connects to Arduino Leonardo digital pin **8**. This line transmits data from the keyboard to the Arduino.
- **KBCLK (Brown, Pin 2)**: Connects to Arduino Leonardo digital pin **9**. This line provides the clock signal for synchronization.
- **KBRST (Red, Pin 3)**: Connects to Arduino Leonardo digital pin **10**. This line allows the Arduino to send a reset signal to the keyboard.
- **5V (Orange, Pin 4)**: Connects to the **5V** power supply on the Arduino.
- **NC (Pin 5)**: Not connected.
- **GND (Green, Pin 6)**: Connects to the **GND** pin on the Arduino.
- **LED1 (Blue, Pin 7)**: Connects to **5V** for indicating power.
- **LED2 (Purple, Pin 8)**: Not connected.

Amiga keyboard specs: http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node0173.html
```
The keyboard transmits 8-bit data words serially to the main unit. Before
the transmission starts, both KCLK and KDAT are high.  The keyboard starts
the transmission by putting out the first data bit (on KDAT), followed by
a pulse on KCLK (low then high); then it puts out the second data bit and
pulses KCLK until all eight data bits have been sent.  After the end of
the last KCLK pulse, the keyboard pulls KDAT high again.

When the computer has received the eighth bit, it must pulse KDAT low for
at least 1 (one) microsecond, as a handshake signal to the keyboard.  The
handshake detection on the keyboard end will typically use a hardware
latch.  The keyboard must be able to detect pulses greater than or equal
to 1 microsecond.  Software MUST pulse the line low for 85 microseconds to
ensure compatibility with all keyboard models.

All codes transmitted to the computer are rotated one bit before
transmission.  The transmitted order is therefore 6-5-4-3-2-1-0-7. The
reason for this is to transmit the  up/down flag  last, in order to cause
a key-up code to be transmitted in case the keyboard is forced to restore
 lost sync  (explained in more detail below).

The KDAT line is active low; that is, a high level (+5V) is interpreted as
0, and a low level (0V) is interpreted as 1.

             _____   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___   _________
        KCLK      \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/
             ___________________________________________________________
        KDAT    \_____X_____X_____X_____X_____X_____X_____X_____/
                  (6)   (5)   (4)   (3)   (2)   (1)   (0)   (7)

                 First                                     Last
                 sent                                      sent

The keyboard processor sets the KDAT line about 20 microseconds before it
pulls KCLK low.  KCLK stays low for about 20 microseconds, then goes high
again.  The processor waits another 20 microseconds before changing KDAT.

Therefore, the bit rate during transmission is about 60 microseconds per
bit, or 17 kbits/sec.

## Help Key Special Functions

The **Help** key on the Amiga 500 keyboard is used as a modifier in this implementation, enabling additional functions when combined with other keys. Below are the available combinations and their corresponding functions.

| Key Combination               | Function                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Help + F1**                 | F11                    |
| **Help + F2**                 | F12                    |
| **Help + Ptr Sc** (on numpad) | Print Screen           |
| **Help + F3**                 | Record macro           |
| **Help + F4**                 | Save macro             |
| **Help + F5**                 | Toggle looping macro   |
| **Help + Backspace**          | Stop all playing macros       |
| **Help + Del**                | Reset all macros (delete all) |
| **Help + F6**                 | Play macro slot 1      |
| **Help + F7**                 | Play macro slot 2      |
| **Help + F8**                 | Play macro slot 3      |
| **Help + F9**                 | Play macro slot 4      |
| **Help + F10**                | Play macro slot 5      |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Key Combination (Multimedia)  | Function                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Help + Arrow Up**           | Volume Up               |
| **Help + Arrow Down**         | Volume Down             |
| **Help + Arrow Right**        | Next Track              |
| **Help + Arrow Left**         | Previous Track          |
| **Help + Enter**              | Play/Pause              |
| **Help + Space**              | Stop                    |
| **Help + Right ALT**          | Mute                    |

### NumLock

When **NumLock** is turned **off**, the following keys on the numeric keypad function as navigation keys by default:
- **Insert**, **Delete**, **Home**, **End**, **Page Up**, and **Page Down**.
- The **arrow keys** on the numeric keypad (2, 4, 6, and 8) also function as cursor movement keys.

With **NumLock** turned **on**, these keys will function as standard numeric keys instead.

## Macro Recording and Playback Guide

This section explains how to use the macro recording and playback functionality of the Amiga 500 Keyboard to USB HID Converter. Macros allow you to record a sequence of key presses and play them back with a single key combination.

### Macro Slots

There are 5 macro slots available, each capable of storing up to 24 key reports. The macros are stored in EEPROM, so they persist across power cycles.
24 to keep withing the EEPROM 1kb size of the Leonardo. If you disable persistent macros flag you can go up to 45 per slot on the Leonardo but macros will not persist power cycles.

### **Recording a Macro**

1. **Start Recording**:
   - Press **Help + F3** to begin recording a macro.
   - Normal key presses will be temporarily blocked until you select a recording slot.

2. **Select a Recording Slot**:
   - Press one of the keys **F6** to **F10** to choose a recording slot (slots 1 to 5).
   - After selecting a slot, the keyboard will function normally, but every key press will be recorded until the slot is full or you stop recording.

3. **Stop Recording**:
   - Press **Help + F4** to stop recording and save the macro in the selected slot.

### **Playing a Macro**

1. **Play a Macro**:
   - Press **Help + F6** to **Help + F10** to play the macro stored in the corresponding slot (slots 1 to 5).
   - The macro will replay the recorded key presses at fixed intervals.

2. **Activate Looping** (BETA):
   - Press **Help + F5** to toggle looping mode for macros.
   - When looping is active:
     - A macro will repeat continuously once started.
     - You can deactivate looping mode to allow other macros to play just once.
   - To stop a looping macro, press the corresponding slot key again (e.g., **Help + F6**) while the macro is playing.
   - **Note:** Running too many loops with many key presses may interfere with normal keyboard functionality and introduce delays to standard key presses. Use with caution.
   - **Note:** This feature is work in progress

3. **Stop All Macros**:
   - Press **Help + Backspace** to stop all currently playing macros.

### Resetting Macros

1. **Reset Macros**:
   - Press **Help + F5** to stop any playing macro and reset all macros. WARNING this cleans and reset the EEPROM.

### Example Usage

1. **Recording a Macro**:
   - Press **Help + F3** to start recording.
   - Press **F6** to select slot 1.
   - Type the sequence of keys you want to record.
   - Press **Help + F4** to stop recording and save the macro.

2. **Playing a Macro**:
   - Press **Help + F6** to play the macro stored in slot 1.

### Notes

- Macros are stored in EEPROM, so they will persist across power cycles.
- Each macro slot can store up to 24 key reports.
- The recording will stop automatically if the macro slot is full.

# Build and Upload Guide

This guide will help you compile and upload the Amiga 500 Keyboard converter code to an Arduino Leonardo. Choose between the **Arduino CLI** (for command-line users) or the **Arduino IDE** (beginner-friendly) to get started.

- Joystick functionality is experimental and lightly tested.

## TODO

- [ ] Refactor keyboard input handling to be interrupt-driven and non-blocking. Implement a processing queue for managing keypresses efficiently.
- [ ] Add an optional Piezo Buzzer to the Leonardo for audio feedback, providing better user experience during macro recording.
- [ ] Multiple layouts.
- [ ] Remap any key on the fly
